# Abstract

Perovskite thin-film transistors (TFTs) simultaneously possessing exceptional carrier transport capabilities, nonvolatile memory effects, and photosensitivity have recently attracted attention in fields of both complementary circuits and neuromorphic computing. Despite continuous performance improvements through additive and composition engineering of the channel materials, the equally crucial dielectric/channel interfaces of perovskite TFTs have remained underexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that engineering the dielectric/channel interface in 2D tin perovskite TFTs not only enhances the performance and operational stability for their utilization in complementary circuits but also enables efficient synaptic behaviors (optical information sensing and storage) under an extremely low operating voltage of −1 mV at the same time. The interface-engineered TFT arrays operating at −1 mV are then demonstrated as the preprocessing hardware for neuromorphic visions with pattern recognition accuracy of 92.2% and long-term memory capability. Such a low operating voltage provides operational feasibility to the design of large-scale-integrated and wearable/implantable neuromorphic hardware.
