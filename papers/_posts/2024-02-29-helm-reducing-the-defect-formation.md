# Abstract

The search for highly conducting Li<sup>+</sup> solid electrolytes focuses on sulfide- and halide-based materials, where typically the strongly atomic disordered materials are the most promising. The atomic disorder corresponds to flattened energy landscape having similar relative site energies for different Li<sup>+</sup> positions facilitating motion. In addition, the highly disordered Li<sup>+</sup> conductors have a negligible defect formation energy as moving charges are readily available. This work investigates the isovalent Li<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) and the aliovalent Li<sub>3+</sub>Sb<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) substitution series of thio-LISICON materials by using X-ray diffraction, high-resolution neutron diffraction, impedance spectroscopy and defect calculations. The starting composition Li<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>4</sub> has a low ionic conductivity of ~10−11 S∙cm<sup>−1</sup> and both substituents improve the ionic conductivity strongly by up to four orders of magnitude. On the one hand, in substituted Li<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>4</sub> structures, only minor structural changes are observed which cannot sufficiently explain the significant impact on the Li<sup>+</sup> conductivity. On the other hand, the Li<sup>+</sup> carrier density reveals a correlation to the activation energy and first-principles defect calculations display a significantly reduced defect formation energy upon substitution. Here, we show within two different substitution series that the defect formation energy plays a major role for ionic motion in this class of thio-LISICON materials.
