# Abstract

Thio-lithium superionic conductors (thio-LISICONs) are a family of promising solid electrolyte materials for potential applications in solid-state batteries. The orthorhombic polymorph of the thio-LISICON Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub> (<em>o</em>-Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub>) has been known for decades, but its complete crystal structure has been reported only recently. Here, using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we reevaluated the crystal structure of <em>o</em>-Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub> and showed that <em>o</em>-Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub> crystallizes in space group <em>Pmn2<sub>1</sub></em> (no. 31, <em>a</em> = 7.7694(15) &#8491;, <em>b</em> = 13.731(3) &#8491;, and <em>c</em> = 6.1413(12) &#8491;). The crystal structure of <em>o</em>-Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub> consists of isolated SiS<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra arranged in a zigzag-type manner, whereas Li atoms are coordinated both tetrahedrally and octahedrally by sulfur atoms of the SiS<sub>4</sub> groups. Structures identified by first-principles calculations support the lower symmetry solution presented here, with the <em>Pmn2<sub>1</sub></em> polymorph being more stable at room temperature than a higher symmetry phase. By knowing the accurate crystal structure of <em>o</em>-Li<sub>4</sub>SiS<sub>4</sub>, we investigated the solid solution behavior with another group IV thio-LISICON, Li<sub>4</sub>SnS<sub>4</sub>. Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction data revealed the solid solution Li<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (0 &le; <em>x</em> &le; 1, &#916;<em>x</em> = 0.1), which shows a nearly ideal Vegard-type behavior for all silicon-containing samples. <sup>29</sup>Si and <sup>119</sup>Sn magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy showed the presence of SiS<sub>4</sub> and SnS<sub>4</sub> tetrahedral moieties, with the spectra showing expected behavior consistent with the silicon–tin ratio in the materials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed the highest ionic conductivity of 8.4 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 25 &#8451; for Li<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>0.5</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, accompanied by the lowest migration barrier of &#126;0.37 eV.
