# Abstract

Understanding the reactivity of ubiquitous molecules on complex oxides has broad impacts in energy applications and catalysis. The garnet-type Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> is a promising solid-state electrolyte for lithium(Li)-ion batteries, and it readily reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> when exposed to ambient air. Such reactions form a contamination layer on Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> that is detrimental to the battery operations. The strong interactions of Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>, however, make Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> a promising support to catalyze H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption. Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate the adsorption and reactions of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> on a Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> surface. We show that H<sub>2</sub>O reacts through the exchange of proton and Li+ and produces metal hydroxide species. At high H<sub>2</sub>O coverage, half of the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules dissociate while the other half remain intact. CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with the Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> surface directly to produce carbonate species. We clarify that the individual reactions of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> with Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> are more thermodynamically favorable than the co-adsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we demonstrate that low temperature and high partial pressure promote the reactions of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> with Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. For energy storage application of Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, our study guides processing conditions to minimize surface contamination. From a catalysis point of view, our findings reveal the potential of using complex oxides, such as Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> as a support for reactions requiring H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation and strong CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption.
