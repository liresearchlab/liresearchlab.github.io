# Abstract

On the basis of the screened 29 hybrid halide compounds from our prior study [Y. Li and K. Yang, Energy Environ. Sci. 12, 2233–2243 (2019)], here, we reported a systematic computational study of the stability diagram, defect tolerance, and optical absorption coefficients for these candidate materials using high-throughput first-principles calculations. We took two exemplary compounds, MA<sub>2</sub>SnI<sub>4</sub> and MA<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>I<sub>9</sub>, as examples to show the computational process, and they are discussed in detail. This work is expected to provide a detailed guide for further experimental synthesis and characterization, with the potential to develop novel lead-free optoelectronic devices.
