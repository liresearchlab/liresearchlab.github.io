I finished my Bachelor’s study at Donghua University followed by a Master’s study at TU Delft. I feel very attracted to researching energy storage materials from a computational perspective. Using DFT in particular, I studied a specific type of solid state ionic conductor during my Master’s thesis. In my spare time, I’m a football fan, both watching and playing.
