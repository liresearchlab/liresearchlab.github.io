Since August 2024, I've been an Assistant Professor at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) in the [Sustainable Energy and Environment Thrust](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/thrust-faculties?code=10011A10000000000H24). Before this, I was an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) at the National University of Singapore, hosted by [Prof. Pieremanuele Canepa](https://caneparesearch.org/). I obtained my PhD degree (2020) in [NanoEngineering](https://ne.ucsd.edu/) from University of California San Diego (UCSD) under the guidance of [Prof. Kesong Yang](http://materials.ucsd.edu/), and my Bachelorâ€™s degree (2015) from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). My research focuses on computational and data-driven materials design for sustainable energy applications, with a particular focus on solid-state rechargeable-battery materials and hybrid halide perovskites.
