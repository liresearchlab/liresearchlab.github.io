I graduated from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2024, where my research primarily focused on theoretical calculations and experimental analysis of lithium-ion batteries. My previous work explored the solvent co-intercalation mechanism in sodium-ion capacitors and the structural transformation mechanisms of cathode materials during charge and discharge processes. Moving forward, I aim to leverage theoretical calculations combined with machine learning to predict and screen materials in the battery field, accelerating the discovery of innovative materials with improved electrochemical performance.
