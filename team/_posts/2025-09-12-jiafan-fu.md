I studied Chemistry at Durham University (UK) from undergraduate through to masterâ€™s level, and graduated in 2025. My previous research training focused on solid-state NMR spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural dynamics and stability of amorphous pharmaceuticals.
