From September 2024 to June 2026, I will be pursuing a Mphil degree at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor degree (2024) in Functional Materials from Dalian University of Technology (DUT). And after that, I trained in the synthesis of solid-state sulfide and halide electrolytes under Academician Xueliang Sun and Professor Changhong Wang. My future research will focus on computational applications and materials design for solid-state rechargeable-battery materials and mixed halide perovskites.
