I am scheduled to commence my MPhil studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) From September 2025 to June 2027. I previously completed a BSc in Chemical Biology from Tsinghua University, working on polymer synthesis and structural analysis. My forthcoming research aims to leverage theoretical calculations combined with machine learning to predict and design materials for solid-state rechargeable batteries.
