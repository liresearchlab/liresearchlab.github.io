					<p>All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) hold promise as a safer and higher-energy-density
                        alternative to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. One of the key challenges
                        in the development of ASSBs is the understanding and control of the interfaces
                        between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes (the right figure<sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01208-9" class="off">[1]</a></sup>).
                        (Electro)chemical reactions take place at unstable battery interfaces and produce
                        chemically-distinct interlayers known as interphases. The interphases' microstructural,
                        thermodynamic, electrochemical, and ion-transport properties are crucial to the
                        device performance such as lifetime, reliability, and (dis)charge rate of ASSBs.
                        The group aims to understand and optimize the electrolyte-electrode interface in ASSBs
                        using first-principles calculations aided with data-driven methods, and to realistically
                        address the remaining interface-related key challenges for full-scale commercialization of ASSBs.

					<p>The urge to advance sustainable energy applications calls for insights into the microscopic
                        mechanisms of phonomena related to materials interfaces, defects, and lattice vibrations.
                        The theoretical investigation of these complex properties often requires long time and
                        high computational cost for accurate first-principles calculations. Specialized machine
                        learning models integrated with expert domain knowledge could speed up and scale up the
                        investigation. Our group builds accurate databases from high-throughput (HT) computation
                        in a fully automated fashion. Based on the in-house databases, we develop graph neural
                        networks (GNNs) to achieve interpretable predictions of technologically relevant properties
                        and to explore the design principles of energy storage and conversion materials (e.g., solid
                        electrolytes, halide perovskites). <!-- data is the foundation -->

                    Liquid-Solid Interfaces in Aqueous Batteries

				<div class="post">
					<p>Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are competitive for grid-scale stationary energy
                        storage applications due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the
                        narrow electrochemical stability window of the water-based electrolyte raises
                        concerns about the stability and reactivity of the liquid-solid interfaces.
                        Specifically, hydrogen evolution reactions result in corrosion of the zinc anode
                        and reduce the Faradaic efficiency of the battery; non-uniform electro-deposition
                        and dissolution of zinc may induce dendrite growth. The group aims to understand
                        the kinetic processes at the aqueous battery interfaces using <i>ab initio</i>
                        molecular dynamics and to improve the battery stability and performance.
