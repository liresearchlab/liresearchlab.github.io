                    [SEEN6000V] Quantum Mechanical Modeling of Energy Materials (Spring 2025/2026)
				</h2>
				<div class="post">
					<p>In the context of global decarbonization, energy materials take center stage in sustainable 
                        energy applications. Thanks to the development of theory and computation power, computational 
                        materials science is playing a more and more important role in the investigation and design 
                        of energy materials. This course equips students with the fundamental theory and practical 
                        skills in materials modeling based on the quantum-mechanical first-principles calculations. 
                        The following contents will be covered: the Schrödinger equation; density functional theory; 
                        Hartree-Fock method; calculations of solids, surfaces, vibrations, thermodynamic phase diagrams, 
                        electronic structure, transition states, and ab initio molecular dynamics.

                    [SEEN6001A] Machine Learning for Energy Materials (Fall 2025)
				</h2>
				<div class="post">
					<p>Machine learning (ML) has become one of the most useful and important tools in scientific research. 
                        This course provides the fundamentals and useful insight into where ML could have the greatest impact 
                        for the students dedicated to energy materials research. The lectures provide example methods for ML 
                        applied to experiments and simulations, covering the early stages of building an ML solution for a 
                        materials science problem, the issue of how to build more robust models, the use of ML to accelerate 
                        or augment simulations, how ML is applied to analyze and process experimental data, and how ML can be 
                        used in the discovery of new energy materials on computers.
